# Image Segmentation Project

This project performs image segmentation using machine learning techniques. It takes input images and segments them to identify and separate key regions or objects of interest. 

## Features
- Segment images using deep learning approaches.
- Visualize segmented outputs.
- Works on a variety of image datasets.

## File
- `ImageSegmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.
